## Lesson 1
The cursor is moved using either the arrow keys or the hjkl keys.

```bash
h (left)       j (down)       k (up)       l (right)
```

To start Vim from the shell prompt type:

```bash
vim FILENAME <ENTER>
```

To exit Vim type:

```bash
<ESC>   :q!   <ENTER>  to trash all changes.
```

or type:

```bash
<ESC>   :wq   <ENTER>
```

To delete the character at the cursor type:

```bash
x
```

To insert or append text type:

```bash
i   type inserted text   <ESC>         insert before the cursor
A   type appended text   <ESC>         append after the line
```

## Lesson 2

To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:

```bash
dw
```

To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:

```bash
d$
```

To delete a whole line type:

```bash
dd
```

To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:

```bash
2w
```

The format for a change command is:

```bash
operator [number] motion
```

To move to the start of the line use a zero:

```bash
0
```

Undo

```bash
To undo previous actions            u
To undo all the changes on a line   U
TO undo the undo's                  CTRL-R
```

## Lesson 3

To put back the text that has just been deleted right at where the cursor is, type p.
To replace the character under thr cursor, type r and then type the character you want to have there.
The change oerator allows you to change from the cursor to where the motion takes you.

```bash
ce change from the cursor to the end of the word
c$ change to the end of a line
```

The format for change is:

```bash
c [number] motion
```

## Lesson 4

CTRL-G displays your location in the file and the file status.

```bash
    G moves to the end of the file.
number  G moves to that line number.
    gg moves to the first line.
```

Typing **/** followed by a pharse searches **FORWARD** for the pharse.
Typing **?** folowed by a pharse searches **BACKWARD** for the parse.
After a search type **n** to find the next occurrence in the same direction or **N** to search in the opposite direction.
**CTRL-O** takes you backk to older positions,**CTRL-I** to newer positions.

Typing % while the cursor is on a (,),{,},[ or ] goes to its match.

To substitute new for the first old in a lint type

```bash
:s/old/new
:s/old/new/g  for all 'old's on a line
:#,#s/old/new/g between line #'s
:%s/old/new/g for all in the file
:%s/old/new/gc for all in the file to ask for confirmation each time
```

## Lesson 5

```bash
v motion : w FILENAME
```

saves the Visually selected lines in file FILENAME

```bash
v motion : operator
```

For example, d deletes the text.
type : r FILENAME

```bash
r FILENAME
```

can insert the contents of a file, and so does

```bash
:r !ls
```

## Lesson 6
Type **o** to open a line below the cursor and plave you in Insert mode.
**O** will open up a line above current line.

**a** will insert text AFTER the cursor
**i** inserts text before the cursor
**A** inserts at the end of the line.

Type a capital **R** to replace more than one character.

Start Visual mode with **v** and move the cursor to choose the text that you want to yank(copy)
