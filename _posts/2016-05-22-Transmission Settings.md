### Using Transmission to download resources from ipv6 sites
Cause the program Transmission is installed by default on ubuntu/mint, we only need to do some little setting things.

Open transmission and click **edit-preferences-desktop**, choose the selections **inhibit hibernation when torrents are active & show transmission icon in the notification area**

On mint,we can easily make a program start before login.Open **system settings** and choose **startup applications**,then make transmission autostart.
