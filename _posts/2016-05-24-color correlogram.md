## One of the primary challenges in digital libraries is the problem of providing intelligent search mechanisms for multimedia collections.While there are good tools for searching text collections, images are much more difficult. If the images are annotated by hand, a textual search can be used; however, this approach is too labor-intensive to scale up with large digital libraries. Automated methods for searching large image collections are therefore necessary. This in turn requires simple and effective image features for comparing images based on their overall appearance. Color histograms are widely used, but this method can hardly cope different appearances with similar histograms.
