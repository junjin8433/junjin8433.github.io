## Introduction
One of the primary challenges in digital libraries is the problem of providing intelligent search mechanisms for multimedia collections.This in turn requires simple and effective image features for comparing images based on their overall appearance. Color histograms are widely used, but it can hardly cope different appearances with similar histograms.Since histograms do not include any spatial information,color correlograms seem to be more effective dealing with this kind problem.

This pair of images shows that two pictures may have no differences when comparing with color histograms, but can tell with color correlogram as showed:
